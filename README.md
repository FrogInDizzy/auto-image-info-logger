# auto-image-info-logger
An auto-image info recording tool for photographers using the palantir AIP platform.

## The core functionality involves:
1. Image upload handling
2. Metadata extraction
3. AI analysis
4. Data storage and retrieval
4. Integration with Palantir AIP platform


## Doman-Driven Design
we have clear bounded contexts around image handling, metadata extraction, AI analysis, and storage. This will help keep our components decoupled and maintainable.

## Architecture
a microservices approach makes sense given the distinct functionalities. We could have separate services for:
- Upload handling and validation
- Metadata extraction
- AI analysis
- Data persistence
- API gateway

## Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics for each service
- Distributed tracing
- Health checks
- Alerting for critical failures


## Security
- Authentication/authorization
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Secure storage
- Network security between services

## QoS:
- Rate limiting
- Load balancing
- Caching where appropriate
- Circuit breakers
- Health checks
- Auto-scaling policies
